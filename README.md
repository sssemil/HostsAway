Here are some interesting sources for hosts:

# Build with Gradle

## Build Executables

1. Have NDK directory in your PATH (http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html)
2. Change to "HostsAway" directory with ``cd HostsAway``
3. Execute ``ndk-build`` to compile native binaries.

## Build APK

1. Have Android SDK "tools", "platform-tools", and "build-tools" directories in your PATH (http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
2. Open the Android SDK Manager (shell command: ``android``). Expand the Extras directory and install "Android Support Repository"
3. Export ANDROID_HOME pointing to your Android SDK
4. Execute ``./gradlew renameExecutables`` (IMPORTANT unusual step!)
5. Execute ``./gradlew build``

# Contribute

Fork HostsAway and do a Pull Request. I will merge your changes back into the main project.

## Development

I am using the newest [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) for development. Development with Eclipse is currently not possible because I am using the new [project structure](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio-tips.html).

1. Clone the project from github
2. From Android Studio: File -> Import Project -> Select the cloned top folder
3. Import project from external model -> choose Gradle

# Translations

Translations are hosted on Transifex, which is configured by ".tx/config".

1. To pull newest translations install transifex client (e.g. ``apt-get install transifex-client``)
2. Config Transifex client with "~/.transifexrc"
3. Go into root folder of git repo
4. execute ``tx pull`` (``tx pull -a`` to get all languages)

see http://docs.transifex.com/client/

# Coding Style

## Code
* Indentation: 4 spaces, no tabs
* Maximum line width for code and comments: 100
* Opening braces don't go on their own line
* Field names: Non-public, non-static fields start with m.
* Acronyms are words: Treat acronyms as words in names, yielding !XmlHttpRequest, getUrl(), etc.

See http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html

## XML
* XML Maximum line width 999
* XML: Split multiple attributes each on a new line (Eclipse: Properties -> XML -> XML Files -> Editor)
